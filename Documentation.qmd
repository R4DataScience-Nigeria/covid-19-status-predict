# Introduction

This project aims to build a predictive model to analyze and forecast COVID-19 outcomes using multiple datasets from the Azure Open Datasets COVID-19 Data Lake. The datasets used are: - **Bing COVID-19 Data** - **COVID Policy Tracker** - **ECDC COVID-19 Cases** - **COVID Tracking Project**

# Datasets Overview

## Bing COVID-19 Data

-   **Description**: Provides daily updates on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.
-   **Format**: Parquet
-   **Columns**:
    -   `date`: Date of the data entry
    -   `country`: Country name
    -   `confirmed`: Number of confirmed cases
    -   `deaths`: Number of deaths
    -   `recovered`: Number of recoveries
-   **Possible Outcome Columns**:
    -   `confirmed`: Represents the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which is a key indicator of the spread of the virus.
    -   `deaths`: Represents the number of deaths due to COVID-19, which is a critical measure of the severity and impact of the pandemic.
    -   `recovered`: Represents the number of recoveries from COVID-19, which helps in understanding the recovery rate and effectiveness of treatments.

## COVID Policy Tracker

-   **Description**: Contains systematic information on government measures taken in response to the pandemic.
-   **Format**: Parquet
-   **Columns**:
    -   `date`: Date of the data entry
    -   `country`: Country name
    -   `c1_school_closing`: School closing measures
    -   `c2_workplace_closing`: Workplace closing measures
    -   `c3_cancel_public_events`: Cancellation of public events
    -   `c4_restrictions_on_gatherings`: Restrictions on gatherings
    -   `c5_close_public_transport`: Closure of public transport
    -   `c6_stay_at_home_requirements`: Stay-at-home requirements
    -   `c7_restrictions_on_internal_movement`: Restrictions on internal movement
    -   `c8_international_travel_controls`: International travel controls
    -   `confirmedcases`: Number of confirmed cases
    -   `confirmeddeaths`: Number of deaths
-   **Possible Outcome Columns**:
    -   `confirmedcases`: Represents the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which is essential for assessing the effectiveness of government policies.
    -   `confirmeddeaths`: Represents the number of deaths due to COVID-19, which is crucial for evaluating the impact of government measures on public health.

## ECDC COVID-19 Cases

-   **Description**: Provides data on COVID-19 cases reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
-   **Format**: Parquet
-   **Columns**:
    -   `date`: Date of the data entry
    -   `country`: Country name
    -   `cases`: Number of cases
    -   `deaths`: Number of deaths
-   **Possible Outcome Columns**:
    -   `cases`: Represents the number of COVID-19 cases, which is vital for tracking the spread and intensity of the pandemic.
    -   `deaths`: Represents the number of deaths due to COVID-19, which is important for understanding the mortality rate and impact on public health.

## COVID Tracking Project

-   **Description**: Tracks COVID-19 testing and outcomes in the United States.
-   **Format**: Parquet
-   **Columns**:
    -   `date`: Date of the data entry
    -   `state`: State name
    -   `positive`: Number of positive cases
    -   `negative`: Number of negative cases
    -   `hospitalized`: Number of hospitalizations
    -   `death`: Number of deaths
-   **Possible Outcome Columns**:
    -   `positive`: Represents the number of positive COVID-19 cases, which is crucial for understanding the spread and prevalence of the virus.
    -   `negative`: Represents the number of negative test results, which helps in assessing testing coverage and accuracy.
    -   `hospitalized`: Represents the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19, which is important for evaluating healthcare system capacity and response.
    -   `death`: Represents the number of deaths due to COVID-19, which is critical for understanding the severity and impact on public health.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in R

## Loading Libraries

``` r
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(arrow)
```

## Loading Datasets

``` r
# Load Bing COVID-19 Data
bing_df <- read_parquet('path/to/bing_covid-19_data.parquet')

# Load COVID Policy Tracker
policy_df <- read_parquet('path/to/covid_policy_tracker.parquet')

# Load ECDC COVID-19 Cases
ecdc_df <- read_parquet('path/to/ecdc_cases.parquet')

# Load COVID Tracking Project
tracking_df <- read_parquet('path/to/covid_tracking.parquet')
```

## Data Cleaning

### Bing COVID-19 Data

``` r
ibrary(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(naniar)
library(tidyverse)

#Reading in the dataset
bing_covid <- read_parquet("data/bing_covid-19_data.parquet")
  
#Exploring dataset
str(bing_covid)
#Checing for missing value 
missing_per_column <- colSums(is.na(bing_covid))
View(missing_per_column)  
gg_miss_var(bing_covid)  
  
#Removing missing varibles
bing_covid <- bing_covid %>%
                drop_na()
```

# Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the datasets and the data cleaning process in R. The cleaned data will be used to build a predictive model to analyze and forecast COVID-19 outcomes. Further data processing and model building will be done in subsequent steps
